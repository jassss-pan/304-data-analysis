      <description>Part I. Abstraction Neighbourhood crime rate is always a topic that people care about. In this short data set analysis, I will discuss the change of crime rates for three areas within three year. The main factor I choose is the change of president for this country and his policy that related to refugee. Moreover, I want to see if this data can make a prediction of future trend in crime rates.</description>
